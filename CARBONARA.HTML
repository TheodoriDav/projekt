   <h1><u>Traditional Carbonara Recipe</u></h1>
   <p><strong> <u>Important message follows:** </strong></u> The instructions below are not required to be followed exactly and it is a personally preference, this is only my personal opinion, you should always try to creat, improvise and use your imagination to create something unique just like you are. </p>
   <h2><u><strong>Ingredients: </strong></u></h2>
   <ul>
         <li>Spaghetti – 500g</li>
         <li>Guanciale – 200g</li>
         <li>Black pepper - with the heart </li>
         <li>Pecorino Romano - 200g</li>
         <li>Eggs – 4 large egg yolks</li>
         <li>Parmigiano Reggiano (optional) - 100g </li>
         <li>Salt (for Pasta Water) - with the eyes </li>
   </ul>
   <h1><u> <strong>Execution:</strong></u></h1>
   <ol>
    <li>Boil the pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to the package instructions, until al dente (about 8-10 minutes).</li><br>
        
    <li>Cook the guanciale: While the pasta is cooking, cut the guanciale into small strips or cubes. In a large pan, cook the guanciale over medium heat for about 5-7 minutes, until it’s crispy and the fat has rendered. Remove from heat and set aside.</li><br>
    
    <li>Prepare the egg mixture: In a large bowl, whisk together the 4 egg yolks, grated Pecorino Romano, and Parmigiano Reggiano (if using). Add 1-2 tsp of freshly cracked black pepper and mix well.</li><br>
    
    <li>Combine pasta and guanciale: Once the pasta is done, reserve about 1 cup of pasta water and then drain the pasta. Add the hot pasta directly into the pan with the guanciale (off the heat). Toss the pasta and guanciale together, making sure the pasta is well-coated in the rendered fat.</li> <br>

    
    <li>Make the sauce:Slowly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the hot pasta, tossing quickly and continuously. The residual heat from the pasta will cook the eggs, creating a creamy sauce. If the sauce looks too thick, add a little bit of the reserved pasta water, a tablespoon at a time, until it’s silky and smooth.</li> <br>
    
    <li>Serve: Divide the pasta onto plates, and finish with more freshly cracked black pepper and a sprinkle of Pecorino Romano if desired.</li> <br>
</ol>

<h2> <u><strong>Key Tips:</strong></u></h2>
<ul>
    <li>No direct heat: The egg mixture should never be on direct heat to avoid scrambling. The pasta and guanciale should be hot enough to cook the eggs when mixed.</li> <br>
    <li>Pasta water:The starchy pasta water helps adjust the consistency of the sauce and keeps it creamy.</li><br>
</ul>
   </ol>
